-- Musketeer Modpack --
For Forge 1.19.2

An experimental highly opinionated "vanilla minus" pack with a small side-theme of multiplayer community building
Removes:
	- The Nether
	- The End
	- Coordinates in F3
	- Elytra
	- Shulker Boxes
	- Mending (as is in vanilla)
	- Villager Trading Halls
	- Villager Un-zombiefying multiple times
	- Totem of Undying
	- Iron Golem Farms
	- probably other stuff i forgor

I haven't done any documentation work ingame yet, that'll come later, so...
What you need to know:
- Ancient Debris spawns in Ancient Cities and Strongholds instead of the respective “portals”
- Blackstone spawns deep underground
- Blaze Powder is now Magma Powder (craftable)
- Brewing the base Awkward Potions is done with Glow Berries (this doesn’t show in EMI because of a bug)
- Check keybinds menu for new keybind options
- Eye of Ender finds Ancient Cities now
- Hearts of Diamond will brew Regen Potions, instead of Ghast Tears (also doesn’t show in EMI)
- Horses are buffed since they never get weaker stats than their parents when breeding
- If it’s not visible in EMI, you can’t get it - if it is, there’s a way, just give me an @ if I forgot to explain it
- Lodestones are easier to craft and compasses can be dyed to be easier to keep a bunch on you
- Lots of vanilla recipes are changed, check EMI
- Matrix Enchanting was made cheaper since you dont have premier exp farms anymore
- Minecarts are buffed thanks to new rails
- Myalite spawns deep underground
- Netherrack can be gotten by making a portal
- Right click another player with an empty hand to trade
- Several vanilla item names are changed, but there's aliases in EMI to find them anyway
- Tool durability has been increased, and broken tools will remain in your inventory to repair
- Use Kiln and Sawmill for more crafting options yay
- Use left shift to cling to walls (wall jump mod)
- Vanilla advancements are adapted to remove content you can’t get, all advancements should be acquirable
- Warped and Twisted Fungi can be found in Ruined Portal chests
- Wither can be spawned with Forgotten Skull, which drops from Forgotten, Stonelings, or Monster Boxes

Plus a bunch of other stuff you can find ingame!

Alpha Notes:
	- You may need to run /reload the first time you load a world because of a bug with EMI and Abnormals
	- Custom textures are WIP, Sully is working on new ones
